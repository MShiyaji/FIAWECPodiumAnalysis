# FIA WEC Podium Analysis

This project analyzes FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) race data to predict the performance necessary for a team to achieve podium status on a circuit.

## Project Overview

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook:  
`day1_session7_FIA_WEC_Races_Predicting_Performance_Necessary_to_Achieve_Podium_Status_on_a_Circuit.ipynb`.

The notebook explores historical race data, applies statistical modeling, and visualizes key metrics to determine what it takes to finish in a podium position (top 3) on various circuits.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Insights into FIA WEC races, including lap times, stint lengths, and team strategies.
- **Performance Prediction:** Uses statistical techniques to estimate the minimum performance required for podium finishes.
- **Visualization:** Graphs and charts to highlight trends and factors influencing race outcomes.

## Getting Started

To use this analysis:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MShiyaji/FIAWECPodiumAnalysis.git
    ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook day1_session7_FIA_WEC_Races_Predicting_Performance_Necessary_to_Achieve_Podium_Status_on_a_Circuit.ipynb
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (install via `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`)

## Usage

- Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
- Modify parameters or input data as needed for custom analyses.
